# NeoVim Setup

I'm very new to neovim for web developement. My previous experiences have been in regular vim for extremely light Java work. Hence as an intro this repository is based on lots of choices made by [theprimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/c/theprimeagen)

This is by no means supposed to be a starting template for anyone, infact if that is what you were searching for I'd recommend Primeagen's own [starting template](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE) as it is going to be a better starting place, both knowledge and adept-ness wise.
